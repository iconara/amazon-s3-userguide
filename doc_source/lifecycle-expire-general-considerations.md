# Expiring objects<a name="lifecycle-expire-general-considerations"></a>

 When an object reaches the end of its lifetime based on its lifecycle policy, Amazon S3 queues it for removal and removes it asynchronously\. There might be a delay between the expiration date and the date at which Amazon S3 removes an object\. You are not charged for the expiration nor storage time associated with an object that has expired\. 

 To find when an object is scheduled to expire, use the [HEAD Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectHEAD.html) or the [GET Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html) API operations\. These API operations return response headers that provide this information\. 

 If you create an S3 Lifecycle expiration rule that causes objects that have been in S3 Intelligent\-Tiering, S3 Standard\-IA, or S3 One Zone\-IA storage for less than 30 days to expire, you are charged for 30 days\. If you create a Lifecycle expiration rule that causes objects that have been in S3 Glacier storage for less than 90 days to expire, you are charged for 90 days\. If you create a Lifecycle expiration rule that causes objects that have been in S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage for less than 180 days to expire, you are charged for 180 days\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)and [Using the S3 console](how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.md#create-lifecycle)\.
